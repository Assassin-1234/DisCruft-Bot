## DisCruft-Bot
### The official community bot for the DashCruft Nation. Here is how you can contribute:
- You **HAVE** to be a member in our [Offical Discord Server](https://dashcruft.com/discord)!
- Once you joined the server, you'll need to help a bunch of people in the support category.
- You'll gain the `Contributor` role once a moderator or a staff member saw you being helpful.
- Everyone with that role has the choice to be apart of project, (will be invited to the organization)
- They must make their own branches and commit to that
- If any credentials are leaked / any private information, **then the accused person will be kicked from the organization!** (may also even be banned from the DashCruft Nation Discord server)

### ðŸ˜³ So, let's make the first DashCruft-Nation project a success!
