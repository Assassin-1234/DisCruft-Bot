# DisCruft-Bot
### The official community bot for the DashCruft Nation. See how you can contribute below!
- First off, get the `Contributor` role by helping people in the support category
- Everyone with that role has the choice to be apart of project, (will be invited to the organization)
- They must make their own branches and commit to that
- If any credentials are leaked / any private information, then the accused person will be kicked from the organization (may also even be banned from the DashCruft Nation Discord server)
- So, let's make the first DashCruft-Nation project a success!
