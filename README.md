### The official community bot for the DashCruft Nation. Here is how you can contribute:
- You **HAVE** to be a member in our [Offical Discord Server](https://dashcruft.com/discord)!
- Everyone can commit their changes as they wish. It'll be checked and pushed by the mods!
- Once you joined the server, you'll need to help a bunch of people in the support category. (Do this if you want to be shown in the organization members!)
- You'll gain the `Contributor` role once a moderator or a staff member saw you being helpful.
- Everyone with that role has the choice to be apart of the organization!
- If any credentials are leaked / any private information, **then the accused person will be kicked from the organization!** (may also even be banned from the DashCruft Nation Discord server)

### ðŸ˜³ So, let's make the first DashCruft-Nation project a success!
